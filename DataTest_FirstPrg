[First Project-Download](datanotationtest_passURL.py) 
This first project was a test to create a python file to pass in a URL and it would pull the data from a table in the URL, transform it and redisplay a hidden message. I had to look up a lot of Python commands as I have not learned much yet, but I was able to get the program to work and display the code. I learned a lot about python error handling, lol. But sometimes that's the best way to learn.
